# Marketing-Analytics
This repository shows my Business Intelligence Data Science project in which I took marketing data and built a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will accept a marketing campaign offer. The data and dictionary can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data.
The project incorprates the entire data science process (data collection, cleaning/manipulation, data analysis, model building, and model deployment)
